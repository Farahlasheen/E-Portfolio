                Rama is an elevator and escelator company based in Egypt. They wanted a new bramd identity and logo from their previous one. I opted for a simple yet clever design. I chose an icon as the logo which is the ‘R’. And for the font I chose a clean sans serif font. Since I sketch, I tested out a few concepts to add for the icon, however, i found this one to be best fitting. The icon represents an elevator within an electric escelator. I came up with this idea while i was playing around with the different shapes and lines of the letter R.
